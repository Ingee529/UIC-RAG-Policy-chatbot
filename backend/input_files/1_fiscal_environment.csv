necessarily when money is paid out. Although some revenue and expense transactions
are recorded throughout the year, at year-end all must be recorded for inclusion in
annual reports. Recording revenue and expenses on the accrual basis requires that:
Revenue earned at a reporting date, but not yet received, is added and recorded
as a receivable.
Revenue received, but applicable to future periods, is subtracted and recorded
as unearned revenue.
Expenses incurred at a reporting date, but not yet paid, are added and a payable
is recorded.
Expenses paid, but applicable to future periods, are subtracted and recorded as a
prepaid expense.

bfpp_1_2,"1.2 Conducting, Recording and Reporting Financial Activity",Fiscal Environment,Procedures,"Financial activity may occur before the related transactions have formally processed
through the appropriate Banner financial system. In other cases, financial activity that
covers more than one financial accounting period may be recorded in Banner. When
these situations occur, temporary entries that adjust for the timing of these
transactions may be recorded at the end of a financial period. This provides more
accurate financial reporting as of the end of that period.
Entries that add unrecorded financial activity are referred to as accruals. Entries that
adjust for activity that belongs to a future period are referred to as deferrals. When
accruals and deferrals are recorded at the end of a particular accounting period, they
must be reversed at the beginning of the next accounting period so the transactions
will not be duplicated or misstated in future accounting periods. Units may initiate
accrual and deferral entries only for these fund types:

following exceptions is met:
1. A unit has a planned deficit which could be a mechanism for overall system
or university funds management purposes.
Units must have prior written approval the university budget offices or
