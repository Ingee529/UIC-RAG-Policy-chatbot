Body
----------------------------------------

To ensure compliance with GASB Statement 84, the term "Agency Funds" has now been
changed to "Custodial Funds."

If a unit needs to act as a custodian to hold non-University of Illinois System funds for

an external entity (called the "owner"), the unit may need to create a custodial fund.

The chart below provides examples:

A custodial fund is a fund held by the system in a purely custodial capacity as a fiscal

agent for the owner of the money.

Money Held for Individuals

The system will not hold personal funds of individuals in a fund type 9D custodial

fund, unless the individuals are students participating in a study abroad program as

outlined in 22 Self-Supporting/Revenue Generating Activities—Account for Study

Abroad and Unique Instructional Activities.

The system will hold funds on behalf of groups of individuals in fund type 9D custodial

funds only when they have formalized their relationship through articles of

association, bylaws, partnership agreements, or a similar document that establishes

the group's decision-making protocol and defines the purpose of the group.

Groups of individuals within the system community (primarily faculty, staff, students,

or their immediate families) must become either a registered organization or a

registered student organization in order for the system to hold their money in a

custodial fund. The system will administer the organization's money as a fund type 9G

registered organization fund.

External entity for whom the system creates and manages a custodial fund.

Role of the University of Illinois System

The system acts as a fiscal agent to hold non-system funds for the owner. The

custodial fund money is not owned by the system. Owner activities recorded in

custodial funds must be consistent with the system’s mission of instruction, research,

public service, and economic development. If used in collaboration with system

programs, custodial funds must record only the financial activity of the owner, not the

system. Unless separately contracted, the system performs only these basic

bookkeeping functions for owners:

Deposits money in a system bank account

Maintains a record of transactions and balances in the Banner general ledger

Processes cash receipts, disbursements, and journal entries as directed by the
owner

Reports transactions and balances to the fund owner

Issues an IRS Form 1099 for disbursements to external parties paid from the

custodial fund as required by the IRS. The system is not responsible for issuing

1099s to external parties from any other funds held by the owner.

Reports to the IRS disbursements paid from the custodial fund to non-resident

The system does not pay interest on money held in custodial funds. Additional

services may be provided by the system in its discretion and pursuant to an

agreement between the unit and the custodial fund owner. For additional information,

contact UAFR at uas@uillinois.edu.

Inactive or abandoned balances in custodial funds will be treated as unclaimed

property in compliance with State of Illinois requirements.

Role of a Unit

Before a custodial fund can be established, a system unit must agree to act as liaison

between the system and the owner. As liaison, the unit may not assume liability or

responsibility for the owner’s actions on the part of the system. For additional

information on the responsibilities of the unit, consult 2.4 Comply with Liaison

Responsibilities for an Custodial Fund.

Role of the Owner

The owner is ultimately responsible for the management of the financial activity

accounted for by the custodial fund. Owners must:

Perform regular reconciliation of Banner monthly financial reports.

When asked, provide copies of the reconciliation to the unit.

Supply supporting documentation requested by the system to process

transactions.

Maintain a positive cash balance.

File required sales and other tax returns not prepared by the system.

Maintain organizational documentation, such as income and sales tax exempt
status.

Ensure the organization does not implicitly or explicitly represent itself as a part

of the system in publications, through logo use, through use of the system’s tax-
exempt status, etc.

Sign an agreement indicating they understand their responsibilities and agree to
follow the system’s terms for holding money as an agent.

Termination of a Custodial Fund
Relationship

The system may terminate the custodial fund relationship at any time.

The system may bill the owner for overdrafts. Owners who repeatedly incur or fail to

resolve overdrafts may have their custodial fund relationship with the system

terminated.

The system may charge owners for system services provided, overdrafts incurred, or

otherwise violating terms and conditions of the custodial fund relationship.
