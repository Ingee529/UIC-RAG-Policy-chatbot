Policy Statement
----------------------------------------

A University of Illinois System unit must serve as liaison between the system and the

owner of money held in a custodial fund. The liaison unit serves as the system's official

contact with the owner and is responsible for oversight of the Banner fund that

provides a record of the owner's financial transactions and balances. Consult 2.1

Policies for Managing Custodial Funds.

If the unit will receive cash as part of its liaison responsibilities, it must be a cash

handling unit. For additional information, consult 10 Obtain Approval as a Cash

Handling Unit.


Procedures
----------------------------------------

To comply with liaison responsibilities for a custodial fund:

1. Ensure that the owner understands what services the system does and does

not provide.

2. Ensure the owner understands that it cannot present itself as being part of
the system. For additional information on what to communicate to owners,
consult 2.1 Policies for Managing Custodial Funds.

3. Obtain the owner's signature on the Custodial Fund Agreement, which is
part of the Banner Fund, Program, Index Code Request form required to

establish a custodial fund and keep the signed statement in the unit for five
years after the termination of the custodial relationship.

4. Request a custodial fund. Consult 2.3 Request Approval for a Custodial

Fund.

understands how to transfer money to and from the custodial fund,

authorize payments, and obtain financial reports.

6. Receive, account for, and disburse money on behalf of the owner.

7. Provide the owner with regular access to reports of their custodial fund

transactions and balances.

Review custodial fund transactions to ensure the activity remains

appropriate for custodial funds according to guidelines provided in 2.2

Determine the Need for a Custodial Fund.

overdraft exists, do one of the following:

Work with the owner to eliminate the overdraft within 30 days.

Establish a receivable in Banner Accounts Receivable to charge
the owner for the overdraft. Consult 5 Receivables for further

information.

Pursue termination of custodial fund relationship if the fund is

consistently in unapproved overdraft status.

9. Ensure that custodial funds are reconciled and make reconciliations

available to University Accounting and Financial Reporting (UAFR) when
requested.

10. If the owner requests additional services, the system may provide additional

services at its discretion under an agreement. Because the process for

additional service agreements is currently under review, contact UAFR at
uas@uillinois.edu for information. For more information on basic

bookkeeping services, consult "Role of the University of Illinois System" in

11. When the system's custodial relationship with the owner is terminated and

the custodial fund is no longer needed:

Confirm there are no outstanding bills to pay.

Communicate to all units providing services to the owner that the
relationship has been terminated.

Submit a Disbursement to External Owner from a 9D Custodial Fund

form to remit any balance as directed by the owner, to eliminate the

fund's cash balance.

email to UAFR at uas@uillinois.edu asking to terminate the fund in

Banner.
