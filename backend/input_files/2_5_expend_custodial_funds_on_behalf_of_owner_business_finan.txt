Policy Statement
----------------------------------------

University of Illinois System units serving as liaisons between the system and owners

of money held in custodial funds are responsible for expending custodial funds at the

request of the fund owner. They accomplish this by submitting transactions to initiate

the expenditure and retaining documentation needed to support the expenditure.

Since these funds are not owned by the system:

Expenditure limits, rates, and policies applicable to system funds do not apply to
custodial funds unless otherwise stated in 2 Custodial Funds.

State of Illinois procurement regulations do not apply to expenditure of custodial

funds unless the owner is an agency, office, or unit of the State of Illinois.

The system may not procure its own goods and services by expending custodial
funds.

Invoice or other appropriate documentation of the nature and purpose of the

expenditure must be obtained and retained by the liaison unit for all expenditure

transactions.

To process a gift to the system from the owner of a custodial fund, see 2.6 Process a

Transaction between the University and the Owner of a Custodial Fund.

To return funds to the owner, rather than expend them on the owner's behalf, see 2.7

Return Custodial Funds to the Owner.

Liaison units may not expend custodial funds using system purchase orders (Banner

or iBuy) unless the owner and system have entered into a contract that provides for

use of system purchase orders.

When the recipient of the expenditure is not a non-resident alien, liaison units may

expend custodial funds using one of the following methods, provided the related steps

outlined in this process are followed:

Banner journal vouchers, when procuring goods and services from the system.

PCards or TCards held by the liaison unit, provided system policies, dollar limits,

and controls established for use of PCards/TCards are met. PCards/TCards will

not be issued directly to owners of custodial funds, and physical possession of

cards may not be transferred to non-system personnel. No modifications to

system software, profiles, Merchant Category Code groupings, etc. will be made
to accommodate card use on behalf of custodial fund owners. See 7.6 The

University Purchasing Card (PCard).

needed documentation and confirm the recipient's legal eligibility to receive payment

before agreeing to reimburse or procure services from the non-resident alien. Liaison

units that do not wish to facilitate these payments must inform the owner prior to

executing their Custodial Fund Agreement that:

The owner may not arrange for services by or reimbursements to a non-resident
alien that will be paid from their custodial fund, and

The owner's custodial funds cannot be used to pay non-resident aliens.

A custodial fund owner cannot use the system sales tax exemption number to avoid

custodial fund expenditures for procurement of taxable goods unless the liaison unit

has retained on file a copy of the owner's sales tax exemption letter. The liaison unit

must provide the owner's sales tax exemption number (and letter if requested) to the

vendor at the point of purchase.

System stores units may, but are not required to, sell goods to owners of custodial

funds. Units that sell goods to owners of custodial funds must collect and remit sales

tax according to 18.6 Sales and Use Tax/Goods and Services Tax unless the owner

or liaison provides a copy of the owner's sales tax exemption letter.
