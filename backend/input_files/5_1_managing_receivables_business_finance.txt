5.1 Managing Receivables - Business & Finance
================================================================================

Category: Receivables
Document ID: 5_1_managing_receivables_business_finance


Policy Statement
----------------------------------------

All units must comply with the State of Illinois, University of Illinois System, and

generally accepted accounting requirements for accounts receivable. Utilizing the

Banner Accounts Receivable (Banner AR) system for accounts receivable

management facilitates this compliance. Every unit must record its receivables in

Banner AR. If this is not possible (e.g., due to HIPAA compliance), then the unit must

request and receive approval to manage their accounts receivable outside of the

Banner AR system. Units that do not use Banner AR must properly manage their

accounts receivable (which includes timely reporting within Banner and properly

handling collection efforts), and they must also compile and submit their accounts

receivable data to UAFR on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with UAFR’s

quarterly accounts receivable reporting requirements to the State of Illinois.

Reason for the Policy

The system is subject to and complies with state regulations including:

Illinois State Collection Act of 1986, Statewide Accounting Management System

(SAMS), and the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (726 ILCS 1026). These

acts mandate that the system must:

Assess monthly late payment charges on delinquent receivables balances.

Perform and track collection activities on all accounts with a balance of $25 or

more that are 30 days past due (which would include Student Accounts
Receivable (SAR) when the student is no longer enrolled).

Resources
----------------------------------------

Submit receivable balances of $1,000 or more with the Illinois Comptroller’s

State Offset System when they are more than 90 days past due. The Offset

System deducts the amount owed from Illinois wages, tax refunds, lottery

winnings, and other state payments.

Obtain permission from the State Attorney General’s Office to write off

uncollectible receivables over $1,000.

Submit Quarterly Accounts Receivable reports to the State Office of the

Comptroller. These reports must include the beginning quarterly accounts

receivable balances, changes to the balances during the quarter, delinquent

amounts and how long they have been delinquent (aging amounts), estimated

uncollectible balances, write-off totals with details, and information about

collection activity.

Submit the system’s Annual Financial Report to the State of Illinois Governor’s

Office and the Office of the Auditor General. This report must include all

receivable balances at fiscal year end.

Return all credit balances of $10 or more to the customer. Credit balances not
returned to the customer must be transferred to the Unclaimed Property fund

and returned to the State of Illinois after three years. If an individual presents

documentation of a credit balance and requests a refund check after the balance
has been transferred to Unclaimed Property, forward the individual’s name,

address, and refund amount to University Payables and University Accounting

and Financial Reporting (UAFR).


Applicability of the Policy
----------------------------------------

This policy applies to all units that generate accounts receivable.

In addition to State of Illinois regulations, the system requires the following:

Ensure separation of duties and responsibilities to meet auditing requirements
as outlined in 9 Audits, Internal Control, and Business System Security.

Encumber SAR with past due balances over $1,500 by placing financial holds

immediately before advance registration.

Review all accounts receivable transactions each month for accuracy. This

review confirms that customers who are expected to owe the system for goods
or services have been charged the right amount and that no customers have

been charged in error.

If unable to bring accounts current after completing internal due diligence, place

accounts with a third-party collection agency that will perform due diligence
and:

Evaluate the cost effectiveness of litigation and make recommendation to

the system.

Close and return all uncollected accounts to the system within one year.

Record all accounts receivable to the Banner General Ledger and reconcile
against records monthly. Identify and resolve all differences.

The system complies with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as

established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for state and

local government entities. These require the system to:

Accrue accounts receivable at fiscal year end.

Estimate an allowance for uncollectible receivables and record in the General

Ledger.
